            <div className="bold">What is Financial Freedom?</div>
        </h4>
        <h5>
            A state of freedom where you can spend your time as you
            wish, free from the need to work for money. Waking up each day
            and deciding how you want to live it. The only requirement -
            enough financial wealth to support your desired lifestyle.
            <br />
            <br />
            The default age in society for financial freedom is after we
            have used up most of our health and time, aged 65 to 70. This is
            when our Governments provide pensions.{" "}
            <text className="bold">
            However, it is possible to reach financial freedom much sooner
            than this.{" "}
            </text>
            Across most of the world, 10 years of work is enough to keep you
            sheltered, fed and happy for the rest of your days.
            <br />
            <br />
            You have a choice how simple or luxurious your lifestyle across
            your lifetime is. In fact, this is the{" "}
            <text className="bold">same choice</text> as the number of years
            you work across your lifetime. This is shown in the [Lifestyle]
            section.

            The Opul toolkit helps you make this decision and answer other
            questions such as:
            <br />
            <div className="italic">
            How much wealth do I need?
            <br />
            How soon can I reach Financial Freedom? <br />
            What is the trade-off between lifestyle and years worked?
